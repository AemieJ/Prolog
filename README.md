# Prolog

Prolog is a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.

Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules. A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations.

All the files included are the initial steps of the Prolog basic predicates and how they are executed in different problems .
Each .pl extension file have comments to increase the readability and understandability of what each steps of the code executes.
